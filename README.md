Our goal is to construct continuous scheduling of task implementation. i.e. to construct such continuous reflection, that will correspond every task to sequence of some intersection  time intervals from [0,∞).

-On every time interval has to be appointed one device. The same task must not be implemented on two or several processors;

-The sum of the length of time intervals is equal to time of tasks implementation;

-One processor can’t implement two or several tasks;

-Must be considered limitations on sequence of the task implementation and on using additional resources;

-If we consider fj   as the moment of completing ξj  task, then there mustn’t be interval in the [0, max fj ] section, during which none of the devices will be compliance with any task.
